# VSCode Settings
The settings found in `settings.json` have been accumulated over time.
It has not been checked in some time, since I dropped VSCode for Vim for
development.

## Installation
The `install_extensions.sh` script includes some of the extensions set
in the settings. Comment out the unwanted extensions, or install them
manually in VSCode.

To create a symlink of the settings on Windows/WSL: Run `setup.bat` as
admin. The existing `settings.json` file will be renamed
`settings.json.backup`
